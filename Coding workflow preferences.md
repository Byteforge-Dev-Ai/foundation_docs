- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality when asked to do so
- Once a feature or specific functionality has been shown to work well:
-- Avoid making changes to that feature's pattern and architecture
-- If asked to make a change get explicit confirmation for that change
- If a change to a working feature or functional area is requested
-- Always check the rest of the code for areas where that change might impact
-- Be mindful of how that change will impact the system as a whole
-- Ensure that the change is well understood before making it
-- Try to minimise the impact on other parts of the system beyond the scope of the task 
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
